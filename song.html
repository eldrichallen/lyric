Going out tonight Changes into something red
</center></p>
<p><center>
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off
</center></p>
<p><center>
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
</center></p>
<p><center>
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
</center></p>
<p><center>
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
</center></p>
<p><center>
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
</center></p>
<p><center>
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
</center></p>
<p><center>
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
</center></p>
<p><center>
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
</center></p>
<p><center>
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop
</center></p>
<p><center>
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
</center></p>
<p><center>
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
</center></p>
<p><center>
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
</center></p>
<p><center>

</center></p>
<p><center>
Everything that you've ever dreamed of

</center></p>

Going out tonight
Changes into something red
</center></p>
<p><center>
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
</center></p>
